Consuming excessive fats and street food can lead to several health problems.
 Many street foods are deep-fried and rich in unhealthy trans fats or saturated fats,
which increase cholesterol levels and raise the risk of heart disease,
obesity, and diabetes.
 Additionally, street food is often prepared in unhygienic conditions,
making it more likely to cause foodborne illnesses and digestive issues.
 Regular consumption of such foods may also contribute to poor nutrition, as they typically lack essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals. 
 For a healthier lifestyle, itâ€™s important to limit the intake of fatty and street foods and choose more balanced, home-cooked meals.
